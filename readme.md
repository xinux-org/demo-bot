## Development

In your project root:

```shell
# Default shell (bash)
nix develop

# If you use zsh
nix develop -c $SHELL

# If it's your first time, terminal will ask you for
# Telegram bot token to set up everything necessary
# and forget about it.

# Nix shell will run bot in background on watch mode.
# However, your terminal prompt may not show, so just
# Press enter and prompt will be back.

# After entering Nix development environment,
# inside the env, you can open your editor, so
# your editor will read all $PATH and environmental
# variables

# Neovim
vim .

# VSCode
code .

# Zed Editor
zed .
```

## Building

In your project root:

```shell
# Build in nix environment
nix build

# Execute compiled binary
./result/bin/tempbot
```

## Deploying

WIP: This one is huge, will take some time to write.
